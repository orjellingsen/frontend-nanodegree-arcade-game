#Frontend Nanodegree - Arcade Game

This game is part of an udacity nanodegree program, where I learned how to make an arcade game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript

##Installation

To start the game, open index.html in a browser, and the game will begin.

The goal of the game is to reach the water without colliding with any bugs. 

If you reach the water, the player will reset, and player score will increase.

If you collide with a bug, the game and player score will reset.

##Other information
The bugs change color based on their speed, with red being the slowest, yellow a little faster, an blue bugs are the fastest.
